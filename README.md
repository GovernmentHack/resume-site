# My Resume

This is a portfolio website for my resume. I themed it like a windows 98 desktop because it sounded like a fun idea at the time.

Current features include:

- drag and droppable files and folders
- drag and droppable windows
- ability to make new text files and folders
- text files are editable and savable
- import resume files from this git repository (or don't, I'm not trying to force them on you)

## Issues

Spotted a bug? or a feature that'd be cool to add? Please just add it as an issue to this. I may or may not get to it. ðŸ¤·. But I appreciate the help nonetheless!

## Development

After cloning, install dependencies first:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the dev server:

```bash
npm run start
```

To deploy, make sure main is up to date and pushed to origin, then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
